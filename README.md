# EmailService
This project uses the Microservice architecture to provide an email service as a C# class library that can be added to any project and used to send emails across Gmail using SMTP. All the client application must do is to configure their sender account settings within their client application. This solution also offers a Database context backed by a Microsoft Sql Server database, that stores all emails, whether or not they were sent successfully. I have also supplied an API (that has my test email configuration) to utilize the email service, as well as an MVC front end application that calls the API service.
